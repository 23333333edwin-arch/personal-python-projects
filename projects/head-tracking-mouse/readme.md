Head-Tracking Mouse Control System

A real-time system that maps head movement to mouse cursor position using OpenCV and facial detection. Designed for accessibility use cases, enabling hands-free computer interaction.

Purpose
Demonstrate real-time computer vision and human-computer interaction principles.
Provide a practical solution for users with limited hand mobility.
Practice video stream processing, facial landmark detection, and system-level automation.

Features
Real-time face detection using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier.
Smooth mouse cursor movement with configurable sensitivity and interpolation.
Dynamic sensitivity adjustment (`+` / `-` keys) and edge-boosting algorithm for precise control.
On-screen display of FPS, coordinates, and sensitivity settings.
Performance optimizations (resolution reduction, buffer management) for stable 60 FPS.
Leverages AI-assisted development (e.g., ChatGPT, Qwen) for efficient code generation and debugging.

Requirements
To run this project, you need Python 3.8 or higher.
