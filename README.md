 Academic Projects in Python

This repository contains a collection of personal technical projects developed during my undergraduate studies in Mathematics at Queen's University. These projects demonstrate practical applications of computer vision, artificial intelligence, and human-computer interaction.

All code is written in Python and designed for educational and demonstration purposes. I used AI coding assistants (e.g., ChatGPT, Qwen) to accelerate development and debugging — reflecting modern software engineering practices.

Projects

1. Qwen-VL Multimodal Model Deployment(projects/qwen-vl-demo/)  
   A Gradio-based interactive interface for the Qwen2.5-VL-3B model, supporting image understanding and role-based prompting.

2. Head-Tracking Mouse Control System(projects/head-tracking-mouse/)  
   A real-time system that maps head movement to mouse cursor position using OpenCV and facial detection.
